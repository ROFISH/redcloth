h2. BBRedCloth

BBRedCloth is a Ruby library for converting Textile into HTML. While fundamentally based on RedCloth, it also contains the ability to convert 

h2. Installing

RedCloth can be installed via RubyGems:

<pre>
gem install BBRedCloth
</pre>

It will install the appropriate Ruby gem. JRuby is not supported, nor is the pure-Ruby version.

If you wish to use BBRedCloth in your Rails 3 project, just add the following to your Gemfile:

<pre>
gem 'BBRedCloth', :require=>"RedCloth"
</pre>

== Compiling

If you just want to use BBRedCloth, you do NOT need to build/compile it.  It is compiled from C sources automatically when you install the gem on the ruby platform.

BBRedCloth can be compiled with <tt>rake compile</tt>.  Ragel 6.3 or greater and the echoe gem (3.1.1) are needed to build, compile, and package RedCloth.  Again, Ragel and echoe are NOT needed to simply use RedCloth.

== Using BBRedCloth

BBRedCloth was designed to be mostly drop-in compatible with RedCloth. In fact, it still retains the RedCloth class. However, this makes running BBRedCloth and a newer RedCloth impossible for now.

If you wish to use the general RedCloth/Textile mode with this gem, just do as you normally do!

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
gem 'BBRedCloth'
require 'RedCloth'
text = "This is *my* text."
RedCloth.new(text).to_html
#=> "<p>This is <strong>my</strong> text.</p>"
</pre>

h3. BBCode

Because of the drop-in feature, new features must be activated. Just put options in an array after the text. For example:

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
gem 'BBRedCloth'
require 'RedCloth'
text = "This is *Textile* and [b]BBCode[/b] combined!"
RedCloth.new(text,[:bbcode]).to_html
#=> "<p>This is <strong>Textile</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong> combined!</p>"
</pre>

h3. Filters

Most of RedCloth's options are supported such as :filter_html :

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
gem 'BBRedCloth'
require 'RedCloth'
text = "This *Textile* and [b]BBCode[/b] and <b>HTML</b> combined!"
RedCloth.new(text,[:bbcode]).to_html
RedCloth.new(text,[:filter_html,:bbcode]).to_html
#=> "<p>This <strong>Textile</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong> and <b>HTML</b> combined!</p>"
#=> "<p>This <strong>Textile</strong> and <strong>BBCode</strong> and &lt;b&gt;HTML&lt;/b&gt; combined!</p>"
</pre>

h3. Disabling Certain HTML Code

Additionally, you can disable certain HTML features of BBCode and Textile and they are ignored:

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
gem 'BBRedCloth'
require 'RedCloth'
RedCloth.new( "Images should *not* be allowed! !test_image.jpg!", [:disable_inline=>:image] ).to_html
#=> "<p>Images should <strong>not</strong> be allowed! !test_image.jpg!</p>"
</pre>

You can disable the following:

* :image
* :link
* :code
* :notextile
* :strong
* :b
* :em
* :i
* :del
* :ins
* :sup
* :sub
* :span
* :cite
* :snip
* :quote1
* :quote2
* :multi_paragraph_quote
* :link_alias
* :noparagraph_line_start (ie. spaces at the beginning of a paragraph do not render <p> tags.)

h3. BBCode-Only

If you want to disable Textile, there is a BBCode-only mode:

<pre>
require 'rubygems'
gem 'BBRedCloth'
require 'RedCloth'
text = "This is *Textile* and [b]BBCode[/b] combined!"
RedCloth.new(text,[:bbcode_only]).to_html
#=> "<p>This is *Textile* and <strong>BBCode</strong> combined!</p>"
</pre>

h2. BBCode

The following are the tags supported:

* [b]
* [i]
* [u]
* [s]
* [ins]
* [del]
* [sup]
* [sub]
* [notextile]
* [color]
* [size]
* [align]
* [acronym]
* [url]
* [img]
* [pre]
* [quote]
* [spoiler]
